2D Arcade Boss Rush game made in Unity 2019.3.14f1 

We destroyed the planet, now the machines are looking for revenge!
As the player you take control of a modified human being reduced to an ugly blob of meat with a gun. Fight and endless stream of pain-inducing machines or die like a pathetic meatsack.

Code, art, music, sounds by Agustín Pérez Burgos a.k.a Retsa Games.

Used a bunch of images from freeimages.com and pixabay.com as the sources for the graphics.

Made for the [Screamortality game jam](https://itch.io/jam/screamortality), the optional themes were "infinity" and "threshold", the game implements the infinity theme with the endless gameplay and the theme of an cybernetic hell where the human race in tortured for eternity.
